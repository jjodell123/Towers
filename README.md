# Towers: Made in high school
PLEASE NOTE: This was made in high school before I realized code style and documentation were important. It's still a fun game though :).

This is a game based on Clash Royale, where the player places various troops to take out the enemy. You can only place troops if you have enough energy, and each troop has different abilities so choose wisely.
